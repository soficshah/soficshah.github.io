			<p style="color:white">Hi, everyone! My name is Saficullah Fakir (Salman Shah) . I was born on 1998 in a small village known as Bisoriya which is located in Suryapura V.D.C of Rupandehi District and Lumbini zone Of Terai Region of Nepal. Special thing is that luckily i have born in such place which is famous all over the world due to it's importance as religious place and tourism place. It means my village is about 4 kilometer far from the Mayadevi Temple(which has been built in the memory of Lord.Gautam Budha who was born in Lumbini and who is known as the 'Light Of ASIA'. )</p>
<h2> EARLY LIFE</h2>
<p> I was born in a normal family of Islam religion. I do have two elder brothers, as a youngest son of my parents i was loving of all . When i was born, my parents  were tackling with economic difficulties to survive even though they have planty of land but since my father have lost my grandpa in his childhood so as being alone it was very difficult for him to manage income and make all family members happy with the fullfilment of their needs though my father has worked har and finally make him strong to stand himself to face all the problems of his life that's the reason my father couldn't get formal education. Despite of his illiteracy he want to make us  succesfull and compatative  in present world so he admitted my elder brother in a ENGLISH SCHOOL and he did same for we two younger brothers . My elder brother's aim was to be a doctor but  due to economic problem he couldn't dream is just broken and he stopped his study after School level exam(SLC). He went abroad then after our economic status takes the path of imrovement and he used to help in our study as before my brobther went to foreign i was studied in government but with his support i got oppurtunity to study in boarding school. </p>

<h3>SCHOOL AND COLLAGE LIFE </h3>
<p>AS I enrolled in boarding school it seems as i have meet a door of my success. So i have studied upto grade 7 in a boarding school of my village ,Apollo English Boarding school. Then after with the help of my family i  transfered to Sidhartha Memorial Academy High School
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ssma.rupandehi/"><img src="ssma.jpg" alt="my collage" style="width:180px;height:180px;border:0">
</a></p></a> which is in a urban area and was about 17 km far from my home so i used to go by school bus and i have passed my school level(2070BS/2014AD) from there with best result that made my teachers and my family happy so they were support me for my Higher Education.</p>
<p> After my school i joined my college Tilottama Higher Secondary School in major of science because i want to be an engineer . In 2016 i have passed my Higher Secondary School.
